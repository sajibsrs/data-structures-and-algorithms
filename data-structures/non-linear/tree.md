# Tree Data Structure
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to its child nodes. A tree starts with a root node, and every child node can have its own children (sub-tree), forming a tree-like structure (upside-down).

## Elements

#### Node
A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.

#### Edge
A link connecting one node to another is called an edge.

#### Root
The first node in a tree is called the root node.

#### Parent / Internal
A parent node is any node that holds connection to other nodes from its bottom.

#### Child
Child node is a node that belongs to a parent node.

#### Sibling
Nodes from the same parent are sibling nodes.

#### Leaf
Nodes with no children are leaf node.

## Properties

#### Height
The height of a tree is the number of total edge distance between root and the furthest node.

#### Depth
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

#### Size
The size of a tree is the total node count of a tree.

### Degree
The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
