# Binary Tree Data Structure
A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes, a left child node and a right child node.

## Types
### Balanced
A balanced Binary Tree has at most 1 in difference between its left and right subtree heights.

### Complete
A complete Binary Tree has all levels full of nodes, except the last level, which is can also be full, or filled from left to right. The properties of a complete Binary Tree means it is also balanced.

### Full
A full Binary Tree is a kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes.

### Perfect
A perfect Binary Tree has all leaf nodes on the same level, which means that all levels are full of nodes, and all parent/internal nodes have two child nodes.The properties of a perfect Binary Tree means it is also full, balanced, and complete.

### Degenerate / Pathological
Degenerate binary tree has only one child node to each parent nodes.
