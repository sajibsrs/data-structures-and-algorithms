# Data Structures and Algorithms

## ðŸ”¬ Algorithm analysis (Asymptotic Analysis)
* Time complexity
* Space complexity

### Asymptotic notations
* Big-O notation - $O$ (worst case / upper bound)
* Big-theta notation - $\Theta$ (Average case / tight bound)
* Big-omega notation - $\Omega$ (Best case / lower bound)

## ðŸ§¬ Data structures
### Linear data structures
Data is arranged in a sequential manner where each element is connected to its previous and next element, making traversal simple and in a single level.

* Array
  * Static array
  * Dynamic array
* Stack
* Queue
  * Simple queue
  * Circular queue
  * Priority queue
* Map
* Linked list
  * Singly linked list
  * Doubly linked list
  * Circular linked list
* Hash Table

### Non-linear data structures
Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner, allowing multiple levels of traversal paths, which is not sequential.

* [Tree](./data-structures/non-linear/tree.md)
  * [Binary tree](./data-structures/non-linear/binary-tree.md)
  * [Binary search tree](./data-structures/non-linear/binary-search-tree.md)
  * AVL tree
  * Red-Black tree
  * Heap
* Graph
  * Adjacency list
  * Adjacency matrix
* Trie
* Set
* Disjoint set
