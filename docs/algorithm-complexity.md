# # Complexity of Algorithm
The soul purpose of an algorithm is to solve a specific problem. In real world there are more than one solution to solve a specific problem. So, how exactly we can determine one algorithm is better performant than another?

To measure or compare algorithms there are two terms, algorithm **time complexity** and **space complexity**. Which determines how an algorithms performs in term of **CPU time** and **memory space** respectively.

## # Time complexity
Time complexity signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion. By time we are not talking about the real world clock time, rather the number of steps or CPU instructions it takes to complete.

## # Space complexity
