# # Complexity of Algorithm
The soul purpose of an algorithm is to solve a specific problem. In real world there are more than one solution to solve a specific problem. So, how exactly we can determine one algorithm is better performant than another?

To measure or compare algorithms there are two terms, algorithm **time complexity** and **space complexity**. Which determines how an algorithms performs in term of **CPU time** and **memory space** respectively.

## # Time complexity

## # Space complexity
